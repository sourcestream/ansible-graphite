# carbon-cache-a upstart job

#
# Tested with Graphite carbon tag v0.9.12 from:
# https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon
#
# Upstart config: /etc/init/carbon-cache-a.conf
# init.d symlink: /etc/init.d/carbon-cache-a -> /lib/init/upstart-job
#
# This upstart job attempts to duplicate the twistd configuration and
# command line options that carbon-cache.py uses, but will not daemonize
# so that an Ubuntu system can properly control carbon-cache.
#
# Fun fact, without --nodaemon, twistd carbon-cache forks five times (5!).
# Upstart wasn't designed to handle that level of wtf.
#
# If you would like to use this with a different instance name other than
# the default (a), replace carbon-cache-a with carbon-cache-<instancename>
# in this file and add '--instance <instancename>' to the script block
# after 'carbon-cache'.
#
# This file is generated for me using a Puppet template I created and I
# suggest you do the same using Puppet, Chef, or whatever your favorite
# configuration management solution is.
#
# Comments added to explain each option.

# GRAPHITE_ROOT is required by the Twisted plugin
env GRAPHITE_ROOT=/opt/graphite
# Twisted requires that the immediate parent directory of the
# plugin be in the Python sys path.
env PYTHONPATH=/opt/graphite/lib

# Since we aren't using carbon-cache.py, ensure that the log directories
# are created before running carbon-cache.
pre-start script

# Details taken from carbon/conf.py and carbon/util.py
#
# Added --nodaemon for obvious reasons
# Use --instance <instancename> after carbon-cache for a different intance
#
# WARNING: the current version (as of 0.9.12) of the carbon code intentionally
# forces logging to STDOUT if the twistd option --nodaemon is used without
# --stdout.  If separate logs are still required for each log type,
# pass --stdout to twistd and filter your syslog appropriately.
